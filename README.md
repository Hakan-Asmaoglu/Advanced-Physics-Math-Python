<h5>The main focus is data analysis and visualization. Data can be a variety of different physical measurements mostly contained using phybox and exported via excel. 
<br><br>Data can be anything that we consider as sensor measurements like; acceleration, velocity detection using GPS, etc.
<br></h5>

<h5>Data is visualized as graphics, drawn line plots, etc.</h5>
